/*!
The reason for this exercise is to efficiently evaluate molecular orbitals,
when a molecular orbital is directly a basis function. Good for homogeneous
electron gas and related stuff (HEG_system). This MO evaluator is constructed
as a retype of MO_matrix_basfunc, which in turn is a simplification of
MO_matrix_standard.

There are some extra declarations in MO_matrix_Cbasfunc compared to its real
valued version MO_matrix_basfunc, since Complex_MO_matrix lacks some
functionality of MO_matrix. Maybe it would have been better to enhance
Complex_MO_matrix than to put it here. After all, we want to have more complex
functionality in the future.
